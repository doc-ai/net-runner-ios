/**
 * Encapsulate the canonical information required to uniquely identify a
 * Tensor/IO model and is used by both the deployment and federated client code.
 *
 * A model is uniquely identified by triple of (Model ID, Hyperparameters ID,
 * Checkpoint ID):
 *
 * - Model ID: Uniquely identifies the model task.
 * - Hyperparameters ID: Identifes a set of training parameters applied to the model.
 * - Checkpoint ID: Identifies the checkpoint at which this model, with these
 *   hyperparameters, was produced.
 *
 * Only the Model ID is required, which may simplify the use of this class, but
 * the Hyperparameters and Checkpoint ID are both required when using the
 * deployment or federated learning clients.

 * Model bundle IDs are more flexible than canonical model identifiers and can
 * identify a model in an arbitrary way. If a model bundle is associated with a
 * model respository, its ID can be parsed into a canonical triple and will
 * have the format following:
 *
 * tio:///models/{model-id}/hyperparameters/{hyperparameters-id}/checkpoints/{checkpoint-id}
 *
 * Note that this is a URL with the "tio" scheme and no server. The path can be
 * applied directly to the base URL of a model repository to acquire the model
 * described by this identifier.
 *
 * Returns `nil` if the bundle ID does not match this format.
