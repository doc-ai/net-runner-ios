/**
 * An Obj-C wrapper around lower level, usually C++ model implementations. This is the primary
 * API provided by the TensorIO framework.
 *
 * A `TIOModel` is built from a bundle folder that contains the underlying model, a json description
 * of the model's input and output layers, and any additional assets required by the model, for
 * example, output labels.
 *
 * A conforming `TIOModel` begins by parsing a json description of the model's input and output
 * layers, producing a `TIOLayerInterface` for each layer. Each layer is fully described by a
 * conforming `TIOLayerDescription`, which describes the data the layer expects or produces, for
 * example, whether it is quantized, any transformations that should be applied to it, and the
 * number of bytes the layer expects.
 *
 * To perform inference with the underlying model, call `runOn:` with a conforming `TIOData` object.
 * `TIOData` objects simply know how to copy bytes to and receive bytes from a model's input
 * and output layers. Internally, this method matches `TIOData` objects with their corresponding
 * layers and ensures that bytes are copied to the right place. The `runOn:` method then returns a
 * conforming `TIOData` object, which is the result of performing inference with the model.
 * Objects that conform to the `TIOData` protocol include `NSNumber`, `NSArray`, `NSData`,
 * `NSDictionary`, and `TIOPixelBuffer`, which wraps a `CVPixelBuffer` for computer vision models.
 *
 * For more information about a model's interface, refer to the `TIOLayerInterface` and
 * `TIOLayerDescription` classes. For more information about the kinds of Objective-C data a
 * `TIOModel` can work with, refer to the `TIOData` protocol and its conforming classes. For more
 * information about the JSON file which describes a model, see TIOModelBundleJSONSchema.h
 *
 * Note that, currently, only TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models are supported.
 *
 * @warning
 * Models are not thread safe. Models may be used on separate threads, so that you can perform
 * inference off the main thread, but you should not use the same model from multiple threads.
