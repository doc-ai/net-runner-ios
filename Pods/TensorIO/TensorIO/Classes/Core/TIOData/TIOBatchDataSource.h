/**
 * Classes which implement the `TIOBatchDataSource` protocol are able to provide
 * data to a model for training or prediction in chunks rather than all at once.
 *
 * A data source is used by the `TIOModelTrainer` class for training on
 * variable amount of data and is passed through to that class by the
 * `TIOFederatedManager`. Application classes will typically implement this
 * protocol and register themselves with a `TIOFederatedManager` as a data
 * provider.
