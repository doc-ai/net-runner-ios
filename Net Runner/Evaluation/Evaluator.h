/**
 * An `Evaluator` knows how to run a model on a particular kind of input.
 * For `VisonModel` evaluators, the higher level evaluators ultimately pass execution down to the
 * `CVPixelBufferEvaluator`, which loads the model and runs inference, returning the results and latency.
 *
 * Evaluators should dispatch their operation to run once and then set the model and any input to `nil`.
 * Running an evaluator a second time should have no effect.
 *
 * There is no default inititialization method for an evaluator, but each evaluator takes a `TIOModel`
 * and produces results, which contain the inference, latency, and other information.
